# Lab: Definite Loops

## Description

Write a program in Python that builds a number pyramid based on a given height. Odd numbers are printed, while even numbers are replaced with an asterisk, \*. Instead of a row printing 12321 it should print 1\*3\*1.

Be sure that your output matches the example format exactly, including any spacing and punctuation.

Name your file "definite_loops.py". Include your name, the date, and a brief program description (you can use the one above) in the comments at the top of the program.

**Bonus (+5)**

Modify the program to create an inverted pyramid pattern when the user enters a negative height.

_Example runs:_

```
Enter the height of the pyramid: 2
   1
  1*1
```

```
Enter the height of the pyramid: 4
   1
  1*1
 1*3*1
1*3*3*1
```
